## MILESTONE 2 PLAN: Utana

**Team:** luucamay + custom army of GPTs
**Track:** [ ] SHIP-A-TON [X] IDEA-TON  
**Date:** November 16, 2025

---

## 📍 WHERE WE ARE NOW

**What we built/validated this weekend:**
- Complete NFT ticket management system deployed to Polkadot Asset Hub TestNet
- Full-stack application with Express.js backend + responsive frontend
- Real-time seat selection with Arkiv blockchain integration for immutable records
- Production-ready smart contract at `0x19493b940443b8f3dFFFD25E094f8EF48686B004`

**What's working:**
- NFT minting integrated with ticket purchases (ERC721 tokens with metadata)
- Interactive seat map with real-time availability and pricing tiers
- Arkiv network storage for seat reservations and transaction history
- Mobile-responsive design with accessibility features
- Complete API documentation and deployment guides

**What still needs work:**
- Zero-knowledge proof system for identity verification
- Community validator network and economic incentives
- Biometric enrollment and privacy-preserving authentication
- Cross-event soulbound identity NFTs

**Blockers or hurdles we hit:**
- ZK circuit complexity requires specialized Noir framework expertise
- Community validator bootstrapping needs clear economic model
- Biometric privacy preservation requires advanced cryptographic implementation

## 🚀 WHAT WE'LL SHIP IN 30 DAYS

**Our MVP will do this:**
Utana will enable secure event access through zero-knowledge proof of humanity, where community validators verify user identity without revealing personal information, creating soulbound access NFTs for cross-event recognition.

## 🎯 WHAT HAPPENS AFTER

**When M2 is done, we plan to...** 
- Launch mainnet deployment on custom Polkadot parachain for production-scale ZK operations
- Onboard initial community validators and establish governance for the verification network
- Partner with major event organizers to integrate Utana's humanity verification system
- Open-source the ZK identity framework for broader Web3 ecosystem adoption

**And 6 months out we see our project achieve:**
- 1000+ verified humans using soulbound identity NFTs across 10+ events
- Self-sustaining validator economy with 1,00+ active community participants
- Industry standard for privacy-preserving event access replacing traditional ID verification
- Cross-platform integration enabling verified identity for DeFi, governance, and social applications beyond events
